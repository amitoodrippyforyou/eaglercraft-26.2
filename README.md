## 🔐 Login Limbo

One of the main features of this server is its **custom login limbo system**.

When a player connects, they aren't immediately dropped into the main world.

Instead, they are placed into a separate **Login Limbo**.

```text
                    ┌─────────────────┐
                    │   Player Joins   │
                    └────────┬────────┘
                             │
                             ▼
                    ┌─────────────────┐
                    │   Login Limbo   │
                    │                 │
                    │  🔐 Authenticate │
                    └────────┬────────┘
                             │
                       Login Success
                             │
                             ▼
                    ┌─────────────────┐
                    │   Main Server   │
                    │                 │
                    │    🎮 PLAY      │
                    └─────────────────┘
```

The limbo system provides a dedicated place for players to remain while the login process is completed.

### 🌀 What is Login Limbo?

The limbo is essentially a temporary server area used during authentication.

Players can:

* Connect to the server
* Enter the login process
* Remain separated from the main world
* Be transferred to the main server after successful authentication

This helps keep the login process separate from normal gameplay.

## 🧑‍💻 Tuff Client

### ⭐ Recommended way to play

This server is **specifically intended to be joined from Tuff Client**.

Tuff Client provides the preferred experience for connecting to this server and is the client you should use if you want the intended setup.

> **For the best experience, use Tuff Client when connecting.**

The server also supports other connection methods where compatible, including:

* 🟦 EaglerCraft
* 🟩 Standard Minecraft clients

However, **Tuff Client is the recommended client for Eaglercraft users**.

---

## 🌐 EaglerCraft Support

Don't have Minecraft installed?

No problem.

The server is designed to support **EaglerCraft**, allowing compatible players to connect through a web-based Minecraft client.

This means the server can be accessed from environments where a traditional Minecraft installation isn't available.

### EaglerCraft

## ⚙️ Configuration

Server configuration can be adjusted to fit your setup.

Typical configuration areas include:

* Server port
* Player limits
* Authentication
* Login limbo
* World settings
* Plugins
* EaglerCraft compatibility
* Server properties

Check the configuration files in the repository before starting the server.

---

## 🛠️ Development

Because the server runs through GitHub Codespaces, development and server management can happen from the same environment.

You can modify the project, restart the server, test changes, and work on the configuration without leaving your Codespace.

---

## 📌 Important Notes

* **Tuff Client is the recommended way to join.**
* EaglerCraft compatibility depends on the client's version and configuration.
* Normal Minecraft clients require a compatible Minecraft/server setup.
* GitHub Codespaces is intended primarily as the hosting/development environment.
* Codespaces sessions may stop when their usage/session limits are reached.
* Do not expose sensitive credentials or authentication information in the repository.

## ⭐ Why This Project?

This project combines a few different ideas into one Minecraft setup:

> **☁️ Cloud-hosted server + 🌐 EaglerCraft + 🖥️ Minecraft + 🔐 Login Limbo + ⚡ Tuff Client**

The goal is to make a flexible Minecraft server that can be accessed in multiple ways while keeping the login process isolated through a dedicated limbo system.
